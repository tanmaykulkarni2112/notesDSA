# Array

When dealing with arrays in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, there are a few key concepts we need to understand beforehand.  

### What is an Array?

An **array** is a data structure that stores a **fixed-size**, **sequential collection of elements** of the **same data type**.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Arrays store **homogeneous** data, *not heterogeneous*

In **Java**, once an array is created, its size **cannot be changed**. This makes arrays a **static** data structure in terms of size.

Arrays in Java are **zero-indexed**, meaning the index of the first element is `0`. So, if you create an array of size 4, the valid indices will be: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

---

### Declaring and Using Arrays in Java

Here‚Äôs how we can declare, initialize, update, and access an array in Java:

```java
public class First {

    public static int[] arrayReturn () {
            return new int[] {9, 10, 11}; // another way of returning array
        }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Declaration and initialization of the array
        int[] arr = new int[5];  // Array of integers with size 5

        // 2. Allocation of a value to an index
        arr[1] = 3;

        // 3. Updating/replacing a value at a specific index
        arr[1] = 33;

        // 4. Accessing elements using enhanced for loop
        for (int val : arr) {
            System.out.println(val);
        }

        // Printing the returned array
        int returnArr[] = arrayReturn(); // Store in new array to access 
        for(int val : returnArr) {
            System.out.println(val);
        }

    }
}
```

---

### Explanation of Key Parts:

1. **`int[] arr`**: Declares an array of integers.
2. **`new int[5]`**: Allocates memory for 5 integers. All elements are initialized to `0` by default.
3. **`arr[1] = 3;`**: Assigns the value `3` to the second element (index 1).
4. **`arr[1] = 33;`**: Replaces the value at index 1 with `33`.
5. **`for (int val : arr)`**: Enhanced for-loop (for-each loop) to iterate through array elements and print them.

---

### Additional Notes:

- Trying to access an index outside the bounds of the array (like `arr[5]` in this example) will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- Arrays can also be initialized directly with values, like:  
  ```java
  int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40};
  ```
- Arrays can store other types like `char[]`, `double[]`, `String[]`, etc., but all elements must be of the same type.


## **Type 1:  Index marking**

The technique can be used for the problems like - 

- Finding missing numbers
- Detecting duplicates
- Finding the first positive missing number
- Cycle detection (like Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare algorithm)

Let‚Äôs break down the **intuition** behind it.

---

## üß† Intuition Behind Marking Indices in DSA

### ‚ú® Core Idea:
Arrays are **indexed structures** ‚Äî and many problems give us elements that fall **within the range of indices** of the array itself.  
So instead of using **extra space** (like a HashSet), we **reuse the array itself** for tracking.

---

### üìå Common Scenario:
If you are given:
- An array of size `n`
- And elements in the range `[1, n]` or `[0, n-1]`

Then the index can be used to mark the **presence**, **frequency**, or **status** of the numbers.

---

### üß™ Techniques to Mark Indexes:

1. **Negation Method**  
   - Flip the number at a particular index to **negative** to indicate the number is "visited".
   - Useful in:  
     - Finding duplicates
     - Finding missing numbers

   #### Example:
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
       int index = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
       nums[index] = -Math.abs(nums[index]); // mark visited
   }
   ```

2. **Increment Method (Cyclic Sort / Count)**  
   - Add `n` or some multiple to mark counts or visits
   - Can use modulo or division to retrieve original values

   #### Example:
   ```java
   int index = nums[i] % n;
   nums[index] += n;  // increase count
   ```

3. **Cyclic Sort**  
   - Rearrange elements such that `nums[i] == i + 1`
   - If not, that index holds the missing number or duplicate

   #### Example:
   ```java
   while (nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]) {
       swap(nums, i, nums[i] - 1);
   }
   ```

---

### ü§î Why It Works?

Because you're **mapping the value to its corresponding index**, you're creating a **value-index relationship** without extra space.  
This is a form of **in-place hashing**.

Think of the array as a board with cells (indices), and every number wants to go to its correct "home." If a number is already there ‚Äî it's a duplicate. If a number never reached ‚Äî it's missing.

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- **O(1) space** (in-place)
- **O(n) time** (usually linear)
- Avoids extra data structures like HashSets or Maps

# prefix tracking/ sliding window

Absolutely! This pattern is most commonly known as:

> ### üîë **"Frequency Counter" Pattern**  
But you can totally think of it as:
- **Frequency Array** ‚Üí when using `int[]`
- **Frequency Map** ‚Üí when using `HashMap<Char, Int>`

---
# üß† TYPE 5 : Frequency Counter Pattern
A common pattern where you **count occurrences of characters or elements**, typically in strings or arrays. Useful for comparison, inclusion checks, anagrams, and permutations.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use
- Comparing two strings or arrays
- Checking if one string can be formed from another
- Validating anagrams or permutations
- Sliding window character matching

---

## üì¶ Data Structures
| Type            | When to Use                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `int[26]`       | When working with lowercase English letters only |
| `HashMap`       | When characters or keys are variable or Unicode  |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Idea

1. Count elements from one source
2. Use the frequency info to compare or validate the second source

---

## üîÅ Common Problems

| Problem | Type |
|--------|------|
| [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/) | Can one string be built from another |
| [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | Compare char frequency |
| [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) | Group by frequency signature |
| [567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/) | Sliding window + match frequency |
| [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/) | Sliding window anagrams |
| [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) | Advanced: sliding window + freq map |

---

## ‚ú® Template (with Array)
```java
int[] freq = new int[26];  // for lowercase letters

// Count frequency
for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
    freq[ch - 'a']++;
}

// Use frequency
for (char ch : otherStr.toCharArray()) {
    if (freq[ch - 'a'] == 0) return false;
    freq[ch - 'a']--;
}
```

---

## ‚ú® Template (with HashMap)
```java
Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

// Count frequency
for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
    map.put(ch, map.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
}

// Use frequency
for (char ch : otherStr.toCharArray()) {
    if (!map.containsKey(ch)) return false;
    if (map.get(ch) == 1) map.remove(ch);
    else map.put(ch, map.get(ch) - 1);
}
```

---

##  Pro Tip
Use `int[26]` for speed and simplicity **if the character set is known and small**. Use `HashMap` when flexibility is needed.

---
Awesome! Here‚Äôs your updated **Type 6** entry in the official cheatsheet style ‚Äî now cleanly split into **Type 6A** and **6B**, covering both single and double element cases. Let's lock it in üíº‚ú®

---

# üß† **Type 6 ‚Äì Remove From Ends (Target Element Based)**

### üß© Core Idea
You‚Äôre allowed to **remove elements only from the ends** (left or right), and your goal is to:
- Either **remove a specific target** (like `x`, a sum, or a value), or
- **Eliminate two specific elements** (like `min` and `max`),
- While **minimizing the number of operations**.

---

### üîπ **Type 6A ‚Äì Remove One Element / Target Value**
> üü® Useful when you must remove elements from ends to hit a **target condition** (e.g., sum = `x`)

#### ‚úÖ Common Examples
| Problem | Link | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Leetcode 1658 ‚Äì Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero** | [üîó](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero/) | Remove from ends until remaining sum is `x`. Try all prefix+suffix combos. |
| **GFG ‚Äì Min deletions to make sum divisible by K** | [üîó](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-deletions-make-sum-divisible-k/) | Remove from ends to reach a valid modulo condition. |

#### üß† Strategy
- Precompute **prefix sums** and **suffix sums**.
- Use a **map** or **two-pointer** approach to find where `prefix + suffix = target`.
- Track and return **minimum number of deletions**.

---

### üîπ **Type 6B ‚Äì Remove Two Key Elements (min & max)**
> üü© Classic when you must **remove both `min` and `max`**, only from ends.

#### ‚úÖ Common Examples
| Problem | Link | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Leetcode 2091 ‚Äì Removing Min and Max** | [üîó](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-minimum-and-maximum-from-array/) | Remove both `min` and `max` by trying all combinations (L, R, Both). |
| **GFG ‚Äì Make array good by removing min/max** | [üîó](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-deletions-make-array-good/) | Similar idea but with condition on array content.

#### üß† Strategy
1. Find `minIdx` and `maxIdx`
2. Try all 3 removal paths:
   - Remove both from **left**
   - Remove both from **right**
   - Remove one from **left**, one from **right**
3. Return `min(left, right, bothSides)`

#### üß™ Code Snippet
```java
int left = Math.max(minIdx + 1, maxIdx + 1);
int right = Math.max(n - minIdx, n - maxIdx);
int both = (minIdx + 1) + (n - maxIdx);
return Math.min(left, Math.min(right, both));
```

---

### ‚úÖ When to Recognize This Pattern:
- You **can‚Äôt remove from middle** ‚Äî only ends are allowed.
- You have **specific targets** to eliminate (`min`, `max`, sum = x).
- Try **prefix + suffix** combinations OR simulate smart index cuts.
