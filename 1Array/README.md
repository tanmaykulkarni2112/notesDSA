# Ways of Solving


## 1. Hashing
1. Using HashSet for identifying duplicates
   
2. Use HashSet/ HashMap to note specific number is present or not. `{keep track of index -> map, else Set}`

3. Using map to group similar attributes together

## 2. Two-pointers
 
## 3. Frequency Array  AND `Bubble sort`

`Bubble sort => arr[freq].append(numberWithThatFrequency)`

[In main README](https://github.com/tanmaykulkarni2112/notesDSA/blob/main/README.md)

## 4. Prefix Array

- Sum
- Min / Max

Create a pre/postfix array and then use it.
We can  have `inserting Res[i] and then update the prefix/ postfix` to get optimal results

> We can use it along with 2pointers
