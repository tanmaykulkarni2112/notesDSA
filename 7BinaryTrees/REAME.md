- Each tree can have:
    - left child
    - right child
- Must have value (of node)

The array representation can be done like- 
```
    Root(i)
    /     \
   /       \
  2i       2i +1
 ```

 1 will have children at 2(1) -> 2 and 2(1) + 1 -> 3
 3 will have children at 2(3) -> 6 and 2(3) + 1 -> 7

 - Height means the max distance to the leaf node from current node
